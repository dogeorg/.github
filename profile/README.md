# dogecoin.org project hosting

Projects hosted at dogecoin.org can be found here. 

A Radicle future:

Over time we plan to migrate these projects to [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz) decentralised Git hosting. GitHub will remain as a MIRROR, kept up to date with the Radicle repos, for distribution. Check with each project to see if they have a Rad repository ID at the top of their README. For now most projects are still hosted directly on GitHub in this Org. 

Projects in this repository are covered by the [Dogecoin Foundation Code of Shibes](https://github.com/dogecoinfoundation/policy/blob/main/policy_02_conduct.md)
